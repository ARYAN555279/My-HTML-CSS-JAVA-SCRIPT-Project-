          Ryomen Sukuna He’s known as the "King of Curses" and is an ancient,
          immensely powerful curse who was once a human sorcerer in the past. In
          the world of Jujutsu Kaisen, Sukuna is feared and revered due to his
          overwhelming strength and cruelty. When Sukuna was alive, he was so
          powerful that his body couldn't be fully destroyed after his death.
          Instead, it was preserved in twenty pieces—his fingers—which contain
          remnants of his cursed energy. These fingers became potent cursed
          objects that could not be eradicated.
